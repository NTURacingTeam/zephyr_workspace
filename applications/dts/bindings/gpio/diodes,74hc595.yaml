  74HC595 shift register as GPIO expander on SPI bus

  Supports multiple 74HC95 connected in series.

  Example configuration:

  &spi0 {
      ...

      74hc595@0 {
          compatible = "diodes,74hc595";
          #address-cells = <1>;
          #size-cells = <0>;
          reg = <0>;
          spi-max-frequency = <25000000>;

          ex-gpio0@0 {
              reg = <0>;
              gpio-controller;
              ngpios = <8>;
              #gpio-cells = <2>;
          };

          ex-gpio1@1 {
              reg = <1>;
              gpio-controller;
              ngpios = <8>;
              #gpio-cells = <2>;
          };
      };
  };
